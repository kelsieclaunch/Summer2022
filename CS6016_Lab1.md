1. TRUE, because adding more attributes to a superkey doesn't make it not a superkey. 
2. FALSE, the key is the minimal set needed to identify the row, adding to it makes a superkey, not a key
3. FALSE, a superkey is a key with extra attributes. A key is like the most minimal "superkey."
4. FALSE, a superkey is a key with extra attributes, and {x}, {y}, {z} on their own are the most minimal sets and therefore cannot be superkeys.
5. TRUE, because a schema cannot contain any duplicate tuples.
